/**
 * How wrong the app's nutrition is, against meals whose figures were published.
 *
 *   pnpm eval:nutrition
 *   pnpm eval:nutrition -- --case bibimbap-2026-08-07
 *
 * The whole pipeline in one number per nutrient: the model reads the photograph,
 * names foods, weighs them and prices them, and this compares the total against
 * what the canteen or the package actually printed. Weight and composition
 * together — which is the number a person sees, and the only one worth calling
 * accuracy.
 *
 * It runs the *production* prompt and the *production* Gemini schema rather than
 * copies. An eval that asks a different question than the app is how v16 came to
 * report good weights for a month while the app received none.
 *
 * Two things are reported per case and they answer different questions:
 *
 *   error      against the published figure. Needs ground truth, and is the
 *              measurement this set exists for.
 *   atwater    the model's four macronutrients against its own energy figure.
 *              Needs no ground truth at all, so it runs on every case and would
 *              run on a meal nobody published.
