// A post is a *copy* made at share time, never a reference into the sharer's
// log. The share sheet promises two things at the moment of the tap — "your
// olives never travel", and "what's in it" travels only if you switch it on —
// and a reference would have to re-derive both on every read, forever, against
// a `MealEntry` that keeps growing fields. A copy is a closed set: the three
// ingredient fields below and nothing else can ever leak, because nothing else
// is stored. The cost is drift — fix the meal later and the card your friends
// replied to stays as it was — and that is the correct behaviour for an
// utterance: a chat message does not rewrite itself after someone answers it.
// `mealId` stays on the post as provenance, not as a pointer to resolve.
//
// Account ids never appear in anything another member can read. Before real
// sign-in, an accountId IS the device id, and the device id is the only thing
// partitioning private logs — showing it to a tablemate would hand them the
// key to your entire log. Members are named by a per-table `memberId` minted
// at join, and by the display name they typed.
