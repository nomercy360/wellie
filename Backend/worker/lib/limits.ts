 * Two layers here, and the third one is elsewhere on purpose.
 *
 * The rate limiting binding is per-Cloudflare-location — counters live on the
 * machine the Worker runs on, which is why it costs no latency and also why a
 * caller spread across colos gets one allowance per colo. It stops a script
 * hammering one endpoint and guarantees nothing about the bill.
 *
 * The per-caller day quota is fairness: one phone cannot spend everyone's
 * budget by accident. It reads a count, so it races — which is tolerable for
 * fairness and is not tolerable for money.
 *
 * The money guarantee is `reserveRecognition`, and it happens after the cache
 * lookup, because a cached answer costs nothing and refusing it once the day is
 * full would deny free work.
