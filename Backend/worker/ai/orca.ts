 * Gemini's native protocol through OrcaRouter.

 * It has to be written out rather than derived from the zod schema like the
 * OpenAI one: Gemini rejects `additionalProperties`, spells a nullable field as
 * a flag rather than a union type, and wants `propertyOrdering` to keep the
 * emitted keys stable. The enums come from the same constants, so a new food
 * kind or facet reaches the runtime schema from one edit.
