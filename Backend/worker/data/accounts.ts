/**
 * Accounts, and the merge that gives one a device's anonymous history.
 *
 * ## Why nothing is rewritten
 *
 * The obvious merge is `UPDATE events SET account_id = 'acct:…' WHERE
 * account_id = 'device:…'`, and it is wrong here for three separate reasons,
 * any one of which would be enough.
 *
 * 1. It contradicts the storage rule the rest of the system is built on. The
 *    event log is append-only end to end — a correction is a `mealRevised`
 *    event, not an edit — precisely so that what was recorded stays readable as
 *    what was recorded. `account_id` is part of that record: it says which
 *    partition this row was written under, which is a fact about the past. An
 *    account is a fact about the present and is allowed to change.
 *
 * 2. D1 has no transaction that spans four tables and an unbounded row count.
 *    `batch()` is one implicit transaction per call, but a merge of a long
 *    history is many calls, and a Worker that is evicted between them leaves
 *    half a person's meals under the old key and half under the new. Both
 *    halves look valid. Nothing detects it. The user sees two months of missing
 *    meals and no error anywhere.
 *
 * 3. It is irreversible in the way that matters. Once the rows are rewritten,
 *    the fact that they came from a particular device is gone, so an
 *    accidental merge — the shared iPad in a household, signed into the wrong
 *    Apple ID once — cannot be unpicked even in principle.
 *
 * So the merge is one row in `account_partitions`: `device:<id>` belongs to
 * `acct:<id>`. Reading as an account reads the union of its partitions. The
 * write is a single INSERT, so it either happened or it did not; there is no
 * half-merged state to detect. Repeating it is a no-op by primary key, which is
 * what makes signing in twice free.
 *
 * The cost is one extra `IN (…)` on every read, over a set that is the number
 * of devices a person owns. That is the whole price.
 *
 * ## Where new events go
 *
 * A signed-in request writes under the *account's own* partition, `acct:<id>`,
 * not under the device's. The device partition is a closed record of what that
 * phone logged before anyone signed in; it stops growing at the moment of
 * sign-in and is only ever read again.
 *
 * This is what makes the awkward cases behave. Take the two the milestone asks
 * about:
 *
 *   - **A device signs into a second identity.** The partition stays with the
 *     first account — first link wins, by primary key. New events go to the
 *     second account's own partition, because that is who is signed in and
 *     those meals are theirs. The pre-sign-in history stays with the first
 *     account, because that is who claimed it. Nothing moves, and the endpoint
 *     says `adopted: false` so the client can tell the person their old meals
 *     stayed where they were rather than silently showing them a shorter
 *     history than they had yesterday.
 *
 *   - **A second device signs into an account that already has events.** Its
 *     own partition is unlinked, so it is adopted. The active phone does not
 *     pull that union into local storage; during authoritative sync it uploads
 *     its own log and removes API-only rows across every adopted partition.
 *
 * ## What is irreversible
 *
 * Linking a device partition to an account. There is no unlink endpoint, and
 * there deliberately is not one: unlinking would make a person's meals vanish
 * from a phone that had been showing them, which is the failure this whole
 * design is arranged against. The link is a single row, so a support-shaped
 * reversal is possible by hand — but nothing in the API offers it, and
 * `POST /auth/sessions` says so in its own response.
 *
 * Deleting an account's data is irreversible in the ordinary way, and it now
 * spans every linked partition. That is the honest reading of "delete my data":
 * before this milestone the same call deleted one device's rows and reported
 * success, which was true and would have stopped being true the moment two
 * devices shared an account.
